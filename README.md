Personal website

The website is created as the result of my experiments with Terraform and AWS
As I have very little of front-end experience, the design of the website could have been better, but it was not the point of creating it

The main idea was to create some static website which could be hosted on AWS and delivered through code pipeline

So this design is still better than the blank page ...
